        Coffee is a cold or hot drink brewed from ground coffee beans.
         But although the coffee bean resembles a bean, itâ€™s not actually
         a bean but rather the pit or seed inside a coffee cherry. This is 
         the fruit produced by a coffee plant. (1)

                 Coffee plants can live up to 100 years, with these trees producing
                 the most coffee cherries between the ages of 7 and 20. In a given 
                 year, a single coffee plant may produce about 10 pounds of coffee
                cherries. (1) The cherries turn bright red when ripe, at which point 
                they are ready for harvesting.</p>
